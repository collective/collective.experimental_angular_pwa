Plone PWA
===========

    This progressive web app for Plone CMS has been built using Angular 2 and Ionic 2.

It largely uses an angular 2 package Plone RestApi Angular which in turn are built on Plone Rest Api. Most of the components and views have been directly extended from the same and customised according to the requirements. 

The other major packages being used are Angular 2 schema form, which allows you to instanciate an HTML form from a JSON schema and Angular Medium Editor both of which are being used to make editing easier on mobile devices.
